# Welcome to betools

A small set of tools I've created to make Python programming a bit nicer.

Hosted on Github [https://github.com/BruceEckel/betools](https://github.com/BruceEckel/betools)

## Components

* `@CmdLine` - Decorator to automate **argparse**
* `visitDir` - A context manager to visit a directory and automatically return
* `ruler()`  - Generates a string ruler with embedded text.
* `head()`   - Does the same as above but prints it.

## Installation

Using **pip**:

    pip install git+https://github.com/BruceEckel/betools

Or, download from Gitub, then run:

    python setup.py install
