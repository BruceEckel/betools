Bruce's Handy Python Tools
==========================

A set of tools I created to simplify aspects of Python programming. [Docs here](http://bruceeckel.github.io/betools/).

To install:
```
python setup.py install
```

Project layout and packing setup derived from [Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html).
