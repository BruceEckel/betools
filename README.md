Bruce's Handy Python Tools
==========================

A set of small tools I created to simplify aspects of Python programming.

## [Docs Here](http://bruceeckel.github.io/betools/)

To install:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/BruceEckel/betools
```
Or, if you've downloaded and unpacked the zip file:
```
python setup.py install
```

Project layout and packaging setup derived from [Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html).
